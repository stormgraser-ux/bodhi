Subject: Bodhi — Your Private Note-Taking App


Hey!

I built you something. It's called Bodhi — a private note-taking app
that syncs between your computer and phone over WiFi. No cloud, no
accounts, no data ever leaving your devices.

Here's how to get set up:


DESKTOP (Mac or Windows)
========================

1. Go to: https://github.com/stormgraser-ux/bodhi/releases/latest
2. Download the installer for your system:
   - Mac: Bodhi_0.2.0_universal.dmg — open it, drag Bodhi to Applications
   - Windows: Bodhi_0.2.0_x64-setup.exe — run the installer
3. Open Bodhi. That's it — start writing.


PHONE (iPhone or Android)
=========================

1. Open this link on your phone's browser:
   https://stormgraser-ux.github.io/bodhi/

2. Add it to your home screen:
   - iPhone: Tap the Share button (box with arrow) > "Add to Home Screen"
   - Android: Tap the three-dot menu > "Add to Home Screen" or "Install app"

3. Open it from your home screen — it works like a native app, even offline.


SYNCING (both devices on the same WiFi)
========================================

1. Open Bodhi on your computer — it automatically runs a local sync server
   in the background.

2. On your phone, tap the shield icon (bottom of the sidebar).

3. Your computer shows its IP address and a QR code in the same shield panel.
   Type that IP address into your phone's pairing screen.

4. Once paired, tap the "Sync" button on your phone whenever you want to
   sync. Notes merge automatically — no conflicts, no "which version?" dialogs.

Note: Both devices need to be on the same WiFi network. Sync only happens
when you tap the button — nothing runs in the background.


PRIVACY
=======

This is the part I'm most proud of:

- Zero cloud storage — notes live only on your devices
- Zero accounts — no sign-up, no login, no email
- Zero telemetry — the app never contacts any server on the internet
- Sync is local only — data travels directly between your devices over WiFi

You can verify this yourself:
- Open DevTools (Cmd+Option+I on Mac, F12 on Windows) > Network tab
- Use the app normally — you'll see zero external requests
- Try running fetch("https://example.com") in the console — it'll be blocked

Your thoughts stay with you.


UPDATES
=======

Desktop: Open the shield icon > "Check for Updates" button. If there's
a new version, it'll download and install automatically.

Phone: Just visit the link again or refresh the app — the PWA updates
itself.


THE CODE
========

The source code is at: https://github.com/stormgraser-ux/bodhi

If you ever want to submit it to the Mac App Store or Windows Store,
everything is ready — you'd just need an Apple Developer account ($99/year)
for the Mac side. The Windows Store is free.

Enjoy it. Write something good.
